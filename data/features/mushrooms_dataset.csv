Season all year. Common. Not edible. Distribution, America and Europe.This fungus is the cause of �silver leaf� disease which leads to the destruction of fruit trees; plum trees are particularly susceptible. The first visible sign of infection is silvering of the leaves due to the upper epidermis becoming separated from the rest of the leaf and lifting in patches. This effect occurs progressively along a branch and on cutting the wood appears stained brown by the fungus. If the wood is cut back until no infection is seen and the wound treated with a fungicide the fungus can be eliminated.Where silvering of the leaves occurs all over a tree simultaneously it is unlikely to be due to this fungus; this can be verified by examination of the wood for staining. This false silver leaf which has the same symptom, that of the upper epidermis lifting, is caused by physiological disturbance such as heavy pruning.",poisonous
